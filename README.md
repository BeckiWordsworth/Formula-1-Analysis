# Formula-1-Analysis

Formula 1 is a massive passion of mine and having found a very extensive data set I thought I would play around with the data a bit.

## Interesting things from the data

The data is from 1950 to 2017 and when looking at the number of wins, Michael Schumacher was leading with a massive amount of victories and Lewis Hamiltom was seventh or eighth on the list. This year (2020) Hamilton beat Schumacher's race wins which shows how incredibly dominent he has been over the last 3 years. 


Despite Ferarri having a truely awful few years, they still lead the way in constructors points (well, they did until 2017, I suspect they have dropped down a bit now)
